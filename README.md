# Stocks Application
> A personal project which aims to create an API-powered Stocks application, based on MacOS [Stocks](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/stocks/welcome/mac).

> Use ```npm start``` to launch the React host locally.  
> Launch [stocks-api](https://github.com/soca-git/stocks-api) in parallel to power the application with real market data.  

> Note: this project is continuously being updated; progress is tracked [here](https://github.com/users/soca-git/projects/1/views/1).

# Stocks Application
> A personal project which aims to create an API-powered Stocks application, based on MacOS [Stocks](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/stocks/welcome/mac).

> Use ```npm start``` to launch the React host locally (+ ```npm install``` if packages are not yet installed).  
> Launch the ```stocks-api``` to power the application with live market data.  

> Note: this project is a WIP; components are being continually added and will be combined into a UI on completion.

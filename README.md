# Stocks Application
> A personal project which aims to create an API-powered Stocks application, based on MacOS [Stocks](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/stocks/welcome/mac).

> App is deployed @ https://stocks-react-app.herokuapp.com -> note that if the Heroku server is asleep, it may take some time to load. I automatically ping the servers frequently to try and prevent them from falling asleep! I have a work-around in the pipeline to keep them awake 24/7.
> 
> & is powered by https://github.com/soca-git/stocks-api

> This project is continuously being updated; progress is tracked [here](https://github.com/users/soca-git/projects/1/views/1).
